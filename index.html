<h2 style="color:green"; id="myHeader";> About Us </h2>
<p> Christ the King Nursery and Primary School was established in 2018 with the view of increasing access to quality education for children from poor economic background. The school is located 47 km from Lira city and 350 km from Kampala, the capital city of Uganda. Presently, the school has 64 and150 pupils in its nursery and primary sections respectively. Additionally, the school has 10 teachers who oversee the day to day running of the school. The pioneers of the school are currently in primary four.
The school is privately owned by Mr. Omodo Denis and Mrs. Sylvia Omodo. They have a vision of making the school a fully operational boarding school by 2021 to ensure improved performance of the students. They started the school with the aim of reducing litracy level among poor households. Majority of these households are located in remote areas and send children to rural schools where there is little attention from district education office.</p>

 <h3> School Management</h3>
 <p>Christ the King Nursery and Primary School has an aministrative structure (School Management Committee) which oversee the overall direction for growth and development of the school. The headteacher is charged with the responsibility of day-to-day management of school affairs. He/she ensures that teachers perform their tasks in a very conductive environment.</p>
